### Mission

### Core Belief
Unity is vital to economic and social progress
We aim to unify and uplift people via crypto and redistribute power, dignity and economic returns to those who use crypto in Markets with lower degrees of economic freedom

We believe that open digital financial services are catalysts for economic independence of individuals from Nation States i.e. the freedom of individuals to earn, own and control their money.
The adoption of open digital financial services will lead to economic empowerment and sustainable economic development of markets with little to no economic freedom.
