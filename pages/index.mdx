### Mission
<IndentedParagraph>At Descent Collective, our mission is to drive crypto adoption in Africa and the Caribbean, 
bringing more economic freedom and prosperity to people of African descent.</IndentedParagraph>

### Core Belief
Unity is vital to economic and social progress of Africans
We aim to unify and uplift people of African ancestry via crypto and redistribute power, dignity and economic returns to those who use crypto in Africa and the Caribbean

We believe that open digital financial services are catalysts for economic independence of individuals from Nation States i.e. the freedom of individuals to earn, own and control their money.
The adoption of open digital financial services will lead to the economic empowerment of Africans and the sustainable economic development of the continent.
