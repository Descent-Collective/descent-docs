## Voting and proposal process for DSN holders

Descent Governance consists of the proposition and decision-making process for the different risk parameter changes, improvements and incentives that constitute the policies, and upgrades to governance itself. 

All future decisions governing the protocol will be enacted through this procedure.
The $DSN token empowers holders to collectively act as governors of the protocol by enabling them with the capability to vote and propose.

### Governance Power

$DSN token holders receive governance powers proportionally to the sum of their balance.

There are initially two powers associated with each governance token:

- The **proposal power** that gives access to creating and sustaining a proposal.
- The **voting power** which is used to vote for or against existing proposals.

Any user can choose to delegate one or both of the governance powers associated with a token, either through our governance portal or programmatically.

**The steps for a successful governance proposal are:**

- **Descent Request for Comments**
    Create a Descent Request for Comments (DRC) to share on the forum and exchange with the community.
    
- **Use the Descent Snapshot to gauge community sentiment and preferences.**
- Prepare the Descent Improvement Proposal (DIP) based on the rough consensus gathered via snapshot and prepare the necessary payloads.
- Submit the DIP to the protocol for a governance vote.

If successful, the DIP's payload will be automatically executed and implemented. For a detailed overview of the proposal life-cycle, see the [Governance Smart Contract Guide](http://docs.descentdao.com).
