## Descent.create
You can configure the behavior of descent sdk by passing different arguments to Descent.create. The first argument is the name of a preset, and the second is an options object.

### Presets
* `'browser'`
Use this preset when using the library in a browser environment. It will attempt to connect using window.ethereum or window.web3.

* `'https'`
Connect to a JSON-RPC node. Requires url to be set in the options.

* `'test'`
Use a local node (e.g. Ganache) running at http://127.0.0.1:2000, and sign transactions using node-managed keys.

```tsx
const descentBrowser = await Descent.create('browser');

const descentHttp = await Descent.create('httpsRA_PROJECT_ID'
});

const descentTest = await Descent.create('test');
```
### Options
* `privateKey`
    * Optional. The private key used to sign transactions. If this is omitted, the first account available from the Ethereum provider will be used. Only used with the 'https' preset.
    * If this is omitted and the provider does not have an unlocked account, the descent object will start in read-only mode.
* `url`
    * The URL of the node to connect to. Only used with the 'http' preset.

* `ethereum`
    * For advanced users. You can inject your own custom instance of a Web3 provider with this, instead of using the default HttpProvider.

```tsx
// It doesn't necessarily make sense to set all these
// options at the same time (e.g. `url` and `inject`),
// this is just meant to illustrate the shape of the
// options object.
const descent = await Descent.create('https', {
  privateKey: YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY, // '0xabc...'
  url: 'http://some-ethereum-rpc-node.net',
  ethereum: someProviderInstance
  },
});
```

### Read-only mode
As mentioned above, the Descent instance can be used in read-only mode, if you just want to read data from the blockchain without signing any transactions. Simply omit the privateKey option.
