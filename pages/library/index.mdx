Quick examples

### Look up information about a vault

This code uses getVaultInfo to look up a vault that was created in the Descent protocol UI. Since this code is only reading data, not creating any transactions, it is not necessary to provide a private key or connect a wallet.
``` tsx
// you provide these values
const infuraKey = 'your-infura-api-key';
const ownerAddress = '0xf00...';

const descent = await Descent.create('https', {
  url: `https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/${infuraKey}`
  collateral: 'USDC'
});

const vaultInfo = descent.getVaultInfo(ownerAddress);
```

``` tsx
console.log(
  vault.collateralAmount, // amount of collateral tokens
  vault.debtValue,        // amount of currency(xNGN) debt
  vault.accruedFees, // amount of fees accrued for vault
  vault.collateralizationRatio, // collateralValue / debt
  vault.liquidationPrice  // vault becomes unsafe at this price
);
```
