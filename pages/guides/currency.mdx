## Introduction
The xNGN module is the user-facing ERC20 token contract maintaining the accounting for external xNGN balances. Most functions are standard for a token with changing supply. 

The xNGN token uses the permit() function to provide offchain approvals, As the owner of an address, 
you can use the permit() function to sign a permission that grants allowance to another address. The address that receives permission can then execute the transfer with the allocated allowance.

For the most part, currency.sol functions as a typical ERC20 token. 
These tokens have already been heavily documented here and it is recommended to read through that documentation for the core functions of an ERC20 token.
