### Introduction
DSN token holders bear the risk of the protocol. Stakeholders contribute in more tangible ways to the protocol, usually in the form of technical integration (DeFi Front End, Keepers, integrations etc.) or financial participation (Liquidity Provider). 
Both have some expectations for the protocol behaviour, safety and functionality

### Use of the DSN Token in Descent Governance
The DSN token is the governance token of the Descent Protocol that allows those who hold it to vote on changes to the Descent Protocol. 
Note that anyone, not only DSN holders, can submit proposals for a vote.
